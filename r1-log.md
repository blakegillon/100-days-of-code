## Log

### R1D1 July 26, Wednesday 2017
Finished Udemy code your first game short course (Pong) and am beginning the freecodecamp front end cert up to bootstrap.

### R1D2 July 27, Thursday 2017
Continued with freecodecamp front end cert from bootstrap to the beggining of jQuery

### R1D3 July 28, Friday 2017
Continued with freecodecamp front end cert from jQuery till the tribute page project https://codepen.io/blakegillon/full/MvaoZb/ however it still leaves much to be desired and I really struggled with getting bootstrap thumbnails to work properly with images within jumbotron.

### R1D4 July 29, Saturday 2017
Started the second freecodecamp project which is the Portfolio website, struggled for a long time getting the bootstrap navbar to work how I wanted it to as when the page shrunk the text wrapped and the toggle function didn't work.

### R1D4 July 30, Sunday 2017
Continued working on the Portfolio project, it is somewhat done just needs the navbar text wrapping and toggle function to be fixed.
