## Log

### R1D1 July 26, Wednesday 2017
Finished Udemy code your first game short course (Pong) and am beginning the freecodecamp front end cert up to bootstrap.

### R1D2 July 27, Wednesday 2017
Continued with freecodecamp front end cert from bootstrap to the beggining of jQuery

### R1D3 July 28, Wednesday 2017
Continued with freecodecamp front end cert from jQuery till the tribute page project https://codepen.io/blakegillon/full/MvaoZb/ however it still leaves much to be desired and I really struggled with getting bootstrap thumbnails to work properly with images within jumbotron.
